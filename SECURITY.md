# Docker Security Guidelines for Anthropic API Client

This document outlines security guidelines for working with Docker in the Anthropic API Client project.

## Docker Port Access Security

Docker's networking model requires explicit port mapping to allow container-to-host and container-to-container communication. This provides security benefits but requires careful management.

### Key Security Considerations

1. **Explicit Port Exposure**
   - Only required ports should be exposed
   - Each exposed port is a potential entry point and increases attack surface
   - Map only essential ports using `-p` or `--publish` flags

2. **Network Interface Binding**
   - Bind to specific IPs when possible (`127.0.0.1:8080:80`) instead of all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`)
   - For development, prefer localhost-only bindings
   - For production, use network segmentation and firewall rules

3. **Authentication and Access Control**
   - Implement authentication for all exposed services
   - Use API keys or tokens for service-to-service communication
   - Apply rate limiting to prevent abuse

4. **Container Security Best Practices**
   - Run containers as non-root users
   - Use read-only filesystems where possible
   - Implement least privilege principle

## Project-Specific Docker Port Configuration

### For Local Development

```bash
# Development environment - binds only to localhost
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000 anthropic-client-dev
```

### For Production Deployment

```bash
# Production with specific port mapping
docker run -p 443:8000 anthropic-client-prod

# Using Docker Compose
# docker-compose.yml configuration includes:
#   ports:
#     - "443:8000"
```

### Secure Configuration Validation

Before deployment, verify your Docker configuration:

1. Confirm only necessary ports are exposed
2. Validate network bindings match environment (dev/prod)
3. Check authentication mechanism is enabled
4. Verify logging does not expose sensitive data

## API Service Protections

When deploying the Anthropic client service in Docker:

1. Use HTTPS for all communications
2. Implement proper API key validation
3. Configure appropriate rate limits
4. Monitor for unusual access patterns

## Monitoring and Logging

- Implement logging for container access
- Monitor port traffic for unusual patterns
- Create alerts for unauthorized access attempts
- Regularly audit exposed ports and services

## Vulnerability Management

- Regularly scan container images for vulnerabilities
- Update base images promptly
- Apply security patches when available
- Use minimal base images to reduce attack surface
