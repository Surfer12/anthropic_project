# Claude Think CLI - Project Summary

## Overview

We've set up a comprehensive Claude CLI tool that provides multiple ways to interact with the Anthropic Claude AI from the command line.

## What We've Done

1. Created an enhanced installation script that generates multiple command variants
2. Added new CLI commands for different use cases:
   - JSON output format
   - Claude Haiku model support
   - File output capability
3. Updated all scripts to set the PIXI_PROJECT_MANIFEST environment variable
4. Improved documentation in CLI.md and README.md

## Files We've Worked With

- `/Users/ryanoates/anthropic_project/anthropic_client_mojo/python_cli.py` - Main Python implementation
- `/Users/ryanoates/anthropic_project/anthropic_client_mojo/main.mojo` - Mojo wrapper
- `/Users/ryanoates/anthropic_project/anthropic_client_mojo/claudethink_install` - Installation script
- `/Users/ryanoates/anthropic_project/anthropic_client_mojo/CLI.md` - Command documentation
- `/Users/ryanoates/anthropic_project/anthropic_client_mojo/README.md` - Project overview
- `/Users/ryanoates/anthropic_project/anthropic_client_mojo/bin/` - Directory with executable scripts:
  - `claudethinkmojo` - Basic Claude interface
  - `claudethinkstream` - Streaming response mode
  - `claudethinkfast` - Lower temperature mode (0.3)
  - `claudethinkdry` - Test mode without API calls
  - `claudethinkjson` - JSON output format
  - `claudethinkhaiku` - Claude Haiku model
  - `claudethinkfile` - Save to file capability

## New Features Added

### 1. Command Variants

- **claudethinkjson**: Returns Claude's response in JSON format
- **claudethinkhaiku**: Uses the smaller, faster Claude Haiku model
- **claudethinkfile**: Saves Claude's response to a specified file

### 2. Documentation Improvements

- Updated CLI.md with comprehensive command documentation
- Revised README.md to highlight the new command-line tools
- Added installation options to the documentation

### 3. Technical Improvements

- Fixed PIXI_PROJECT_MANIFEST warning in all scripts
- Enhanced error checking in the file output script
- Improved installation script with multiple installation options

## Current Status

The CLI tools are now properly installed and should be accessible system-wide after adding them to your PATH. Each script uses absolute paths and sets the correct PIXI manifest path. The new command variants provide more flexibility in how you interact with Claude.

## Next Steps

1. Test all commands from any directory
2. Consider adding more specialized variants for specific use cases:
   - A script for code generation with appropriate system prompts
   - A script for multi-turn conversations with conversation history
   - A script for batch processing multiple prompts
3. Enhance error handling in all scripts
4. Create comprehensive examples of using the tools in various workflows
