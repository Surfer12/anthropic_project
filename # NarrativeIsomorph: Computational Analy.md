# Extended Requirements Analysis for NarrativeIsomorph Implementation

## 1. Advanced Semantic Representation Frameworks

The current proposal relies on basic embedding models that may inadequately capture narrative-specific structural properties. We should incorporate:

```python
class NarrativeRepresentation:
    def __init__(self, model_config=None):
        self.base_encoder = SentenceTransformer('all-mpnet-base-v2')
        self.narrative_encoder = NarrativeSpecificEncoder(
            base_encoder=self.base_encoder,
            narrative_features=["event_sequence", "character_relations", 
                               "causal_links", "temporal_structure"]
        )
        
    def encode_narrative_structure(self, text):
        """
        Generates narrative-specific structural representations beyond 
        semantic embeddings
        
        Returns:
            - event_graph: Directed graph of narrative events
            - entity_relations: Tensor representation of entity relationships
            - causal_structure: Causal dependency graph
            - discourse_structure: Rhetorical structure representation
        """
        # Implementation using narrative structure parsing
        pass
```

These advanced representations would enable more precise isomorphism detection between narratives processed by different architectures.

## 2. Cross-Architectural Model Interface Standardization

The current implementation lacks a standardized protocol for model interaction across diverse architectures:

```python
class ArchitecturalInterfaceRegistry:
    def __init__(self):
        self.registered_interfaces = {}
        
    def register_architecture(self, architecture_id, interface_spec):
        """
        Registers interface specifications for different model architectures
        
        Parameters:
            - architecture_id: Unique identifier for model architecture
            - interface_spec: Dict containing API endpoints, parameter mappings,
                             response parsing rules, and authentication methods
        """
        self.registered_interfaces[architecture_id] = interface_spec
        
    def create_standardized_interface(self, architecture_id):
        """
        Creates standardized interface object for specified architecture
        
        Returns:
            ModelInterface: Object with standardized methods regardless of 
                           underlying architecture
        """
        spec = self.registered_interfaces.get(architecture_id)
        if not spec:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown architecture: {architecture_id}")
        
        return ModelInterface(spec)
```

This standardization is essential for reliable cross-architectural comparisons and would eliminate inconsistencies in model interaction patterns.

## 3. Formal Isomorphism Theory Implementation

The proposal lacks a rigorous mathematical foundation for isomorphism detection:

```python
class NarrativeIsomorphismCalculus:
    """
    Implements formal calculus for narrative isomorphism detection based on 
    category theory and structural similarity metrics
    """
    
    def compute_structural_homomorphism(self, source_structure, target_structure):
        """
        Computes degree of structural preservation between narrative structures
        
        Parameters:
            - source_structure: Graph representation of source narrative
            - target_structure: Graph representation of target narrative
            
        Returns:
            - homomorphism_measure: Float in [0,1] indicating structural preservation
            - mapping_function: Dict mapping source nodes to target nodes
            - preservation_analysis: Analysis of preserved and transformed properties
        """
        # Implementation using category-theoretic approaches
        pass
        
    def calculate_functional_isomorphism(self, source_functions, target_functions):
        """
        Computes functional isomorphisms between narrative operations
        
        Parameters:
            - source_functions: Dict mapping operation types to functions in source
            - target_functions: Dict mapping operation types to functions in target
            
        Returns:
            - functional_isomorphism: Measure of operational equivalence
        """
        # Implementation using functional equivalence testing
        pass
```

This formalization would provide mathematically rigorous foundations for isomorphism claims.

## 4. Multi-Scale Temporal Analysis Framework

The current proposal overlooks temporal dynamics across narrative scales:

```python
class MultiScaleTemporalAnalysis:
    """
    Implements multi-scale temporal analysis for narrative structures
    """
    
    def extract_temporal_scales(self, narrative):
        """
        Extracts multiple temporal scales from narrative
        
        Returns:
            Dict mapping temporal scale to sequential structure
        """
        scales = {
            'micro': self._extract_micro_events(narrative),
            'meso': self._extract_episodes(narrative),
            'macro': self._extract_narrative_arcs(narrative)
        }
        return scales
        
    def compute_temporal_isomorphisms(self, source_scales, target_scales):
        """
        Computes isomorphisms at each temporal scale
        
        Returns:
            Dict mapping scale to isomorphism measure
        """
        # Implementation of scale-specific isomorphism detection
        pass
```

This framework would address critical temporal dependencies in narrative transformation that current approaches might miss.

## 5. Statistical Validation Framework

The proposal requires rigorous statistical validation methods:

```python
class IsomorphismStatisticalValidation:
    """
    Implements statistical validation for isomorphism claims
    """
    
    def generate_null_distribution(self, architecture, narrative_type, n_samples=1000):
        """
        Generates null distribution of isomorphism scores for statistical comparison
        
        Returns:
            numpy.ndarray: Distribution of isomorphism scores under null hypothesis
        """
        # Implementation of permutation-based null distribution generation
        pass
        
    def calculate_significance(self, observed_value, null_distribution):
        """
        Calculates statistical significance of observed isomorphism
        
        Returns:
            float: p-value indicating significance
            float: effect size
        """
        # Implementation of statistical significance calculation
        pass
```

This validation framework is essential for distinguishing meaningful isomorphisms from random structural similarities.

## 6. Cross-Cultural Narrative Schema Repository

The current proposal does not account for cultural variations in narrative structure:

```python
class CulturalNarrativeSchemaRegistry:
    """
    Registry for culture-specific narrative schemas
    """
    
    def register_cultural_schema(self, culture_id, narrative_schema):
        """
        Registers culture-specific narrative schema
        
        Parameters:
            - culture_id: Identifier for cultural tradition
            - narrative_schema: Formal representation of narrative conventions
        """
        # Implementation for schema registration
        pass
        
    def analyze_cultural_transformation(self, source_narrative, target_narrative, 
                                       source_culture, target_culture):
        """
        Analyzes narrative transformation accounting for cultural schemas
        
        Returns:
            Dict containing culture-adjusted transformation metrics
        """
        # Implementation of culture-aware transformation analysis
        pass
```

This repository would enable culturally-informed analysis of narrative transformations across architectural boundaries.

## 7. Computational Resource Optimization

The proposal requires optimization for computational efficiency:

```python
class ComputationalOptimization:
    """
    Implements optimization strategies for resource-intensive operations
    """
    
    def optimize_isomorphism_detection(self, narrative_size, complexity):
        """
        Selects optimal algorithm based on narrative characteristics
        
        Returns:
            algorithm_config: Configuration for optimal isomorphism detection
        """
        if narrative_size < 1000 and complexity < 0.3:
            return self.exact_isomorphism_config()
        elif narrative_size < 5000 and complexity < 0.7:
            return self.approximate_isomorphism_config()
        else:
            return self.heuristic_isomorphism_config()
    
    def distribute_computation(self, narrative_pairs, available_resources):
        """
        Distributes computation across available resources
        
        Returns:
            computation_plan: Dict mapping computational tasks to resources
        """
        # Implementation of resource allocation optimization
        pass
```

These optimizations would make cross-architectural analysis of complex narratives computationally tractable.

## 8. Ethical Considerations Framework

The proposal must address ethical implications of narrative analysis:

```python
class NarrativeEthicsFramework:
    """
    Framework for ethical considerations in narrative analysis
    """
    
    def evaluate_narrative_bias(self, narrative, dimensions=None):
        """
        Evaluates potential biases in narrative along multiple dimensions
        
        Returns:
            Dict mapping bias dimensions to quantitative measures
        """
        dimensions = dimensions or ["gender", "cultural", "ideological", 
                                   "historical", "technological"]
        # Implementation of multi-dimensional bias detection
        pass
        
    def assess_transformation_ethics(self, source_narrative, target_narrative):
        """
        Assesses ethical implications of narrative transformation
        
        Returns:
            Dict containing ethical assessment metrics
        """
        # Implementation of transformation ethics assessment
        pass
```

This framework ensures responsible development and application of narrative analysis technologies.

These additions would significantly enhance the methodological rigor, computational efficiency, and ethical foundations of the NarrativeIsomorph project, ensuring more reliable cross-architectural analysis of narrative transformations.
