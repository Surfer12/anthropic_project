  We set up a Claude CLI tool that provides an interface to interact with Claude AI from the command line.

  What we did:

  1. Identified an issue with running python_cli.py in your Anthropic client project
  2. Examined the project structure and files (main.mojo, python_cli.py, bash scripts)
  3. Created proper executable scripts in a bin directory with absolute paths
  4. Added the bin directory to your PATH in ~/.zshrc
  5. Fixed a warning regarding PIXI_PROJECT_MANIFEST by explicitly setting the environment variable

  Files we worked with:

  - /Users/ryanoates/anthropic_project/anthropic_client_mojo/python_cli.py - Main Python implementation
  - /Users/ryanoates/anthropic_project/anthropic_client_mojo/main.mojo - Mojo wrapper
  - /Users/ryanoates/anthropic_project/anthropic_client_mojo/bin/ - Directory with executable scripts:
    - claudethinkmojo - Basic Claude interface
    - claudethinkstream - Streaming response mode
    - claudethinkfast - Lower temperature mode (0.3)
    - claudethinkdry - Test mode without API calls
  - /Users/ryanoates/anthropic_project/anthropic_client_mojo/pixi.toml - Project dependencies

  Current status:

  The CLI tools are now properly installed and should be accessible system-wide after running source ~/.zshrc.
  Each script uses absolute paths and sets the correct PIXI manifest path.

  Next steps:

  1. Test the commands by running them from any directory
  2. Consider adding more functionality or custom options to the CLI tools
  3. If needed, update the project's README with installation and usage instructions
