# <cognitive_framework>Recursive Intention Modeling for Spravato Therapeutic Process</cognitive_framework>

<structured_analysis>
    <understanding>
        Spravato therapy operates at a neurochemical intersection that enables profound cognitive restructuring through NMDA receptor modulation. Applying recursive thought structures to intention-setting creates a nested framework where therapeutic outcomes can emerge through multi-layered cognitive processing.

        <key_components>
            - Anchored reference states (&therapeutic_anchor)
            - Recursive thought exploration (*exploration)
            - Meta-cognitive observation layers (!reflection_tag)
            - Nested intention structures with aliasing capabilities
        </key_components>
        
        <deep_analysis>
            The CCT (Chain of Thought) model demonstrated in the Mojo implementation provides an ideal structural template for Spravato intention-setting. The ThoughtNode architecture with its recursion, aliasing, and memoization mirrors how ketamine-induced neuroplasticity operates - creating new connections while temporarily suspending habitual cognitive patterns.

            Similar to how the Mojo CCT model employs `struct ThoughtNode` with `subThoughts` and `aliasNode` properties, therapeutic intentions can be modeled as hierarchical structures with:
            
            ```
            struct TherapeuticIntent {
                var id: Int
                var core_intention: String
                var sub_intentions: List[TherapeuticIntent]
                var anchor_reference: Pointer[TherapeuticIntent]
                var emergence_cache: String
            }
            ```
            
            This architecture enables both depth (recursive descent into sub-intentions) and lateral connections (anchor references to established therapeutic states).

<meta_cognitive_framework>
    <theoretical_integration>
        This approach synthesizes three domains:
        
        1. **Computational recursion** (from the Mojo CCT model): Providing structural paradigms for organizing nested intentions with memoization
        
        2. **YAML anchors and references**: Enabling experience mapping across mental states similar to how aliasNode functions in the Mojo code
        
        3. **Psychedelic-assisted therapy frameworks**: Leveraging the transient neuroplasticity induced by Spravato to establish new cognitive reference points
        
        The fundamental insight is that ketamine's temporary disruption of default mode network functioning parallels how recursion breaks hierarchical thought patterns, creating space for novel cognitive connections.
    </theoretical_integration>
    
    <practical_application>
        Before each Spravato session:
        1. Initialize the intention structure with primary anchors
        2. Define recursive depth parameters (how deep to explore each branch)
        3. Establish "return paths" (similar to base cases in recursive functions)
        
        During Spravato session:
        1. Hold primary intention as initial state
        2. Allow recursive exploration through sub-intentions
        3. Utilize anchor references when experiencing cognitive loops
        4. Apply emergence_cache to capture insights for post-session integration
        
        Post-session integration:
        1. Map the traversed intention paths
        2. Identify novel connections between previously unrelated anchors
        3. Memoize effective intention structures for future sessions
    </practical_application>
</meta_cognitive_framework>

<implementation_considerations>
    <limitations>
        - Cognitive recursion depth may exceed comfortable processing capacity during dissociative states
        - Attachment to predetermined intention structures might limit emergent insights
        - Memoization of therapeutic insights requires careful balancing with openness to new experience
    </limitations>
    
    <recursive_safety_patterns>
        Just as the Mojo factorial example implements boundary checking to prevent unintended large computations, therapeutic recursion requires:
        
        ```
        fn evaluateIntentionDepth(self: inout TherapeuticSession, intentPtr: Pointer[TherapeuticIntent], currentDepth: Int) -> str:
            # Safety check to prevent overwhelming recursion
            if currentDepth > self.maxSafeRecursionDepth:
                return self.returnToAnchor(self.primarySafetyAnchor)
                
            # Continue intention exploration if within safe parameters
            # ...
        ```
        
        This pattern ensures cognitive exploration remains within therapeutic boundaries.
    </recursive_safety_patterns>
</implementation_considerations>

<integration_strategy>
    The implementation of this framework requires bidirectional mapping between abstract intention structures and embodied experience. Similar to how the CCTModel utilizes memoization to optimize cognitive processing, therapeutic integration leverages:
    
    1. **Somatic bookmarking**: Establishing physiological reference points that anchor cognitive insights
    
    2. **Multi-state learning transfer**: Ensuring insights accessible in non-ordinary states become available in default consciousness
    
    3. **Environmental e mbedding**: Creating external cues that activate intention anchors in daily life
    
    This approach transforms the theoretical recursive model into lived neuroplastic change, bridging cognitive restructuring with behavioral implementation.
