# CLI Tool Examples and Test Cases

This document provides examples of using commands from any directory. It includes specialized variants for specific use cases: code generation, multi-turn conversation with conversation history, and batch processing multiple prompts. Additionally, this guide includes examples of enhanced error handling in scripts.

## Testing All Commands

This section includes basic tests for each command and tool available from any directory, including memory storing, shell execution, file editing, and web scraping.

### Example Commands:

- **Memory Storage**: 
    ```bash
    functions.memory__remember_memory({ category: "test", data: "This is a test memory", is_global: false, tags: ["test", "cli"] })
    ```

- **Retrieve All Test Memories**: 
    ```bash
    functions.memory__retrieve_memories({ category: "test", is_global: false });
    ```

- **Shell Command Execution**:
    ```bash
    functions.developer__shell({ command: "echo 'Hello from testing CLI'" });
    ```

- **Edit File (Viewing Purpose)**:
    ```bash
    functions.developer__text_editor({ command: "view", path: "/path/to/some/file.txt" });
    ```

## Specialized Variants

### Code Generation Script

This script sets up an environment to generate code using system prompts and uses the available tools for validation.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# codegen.sh - A script to generate code with system prompts

read -p "Enter your programming language (e.g., Python, JavaScript): " language
read -p "Enter your code prompt: " prompt

# Validate input
if [ -z "$language" ] || [ -z "$prompt" ]; then
  echo "Error: Both language and prompt must be provided."
  exit 1
fi

# System command simulation for code generation. (Replace with actual code generation API)
generated_code="Generated code for $language: \n// $prompt \nfunction example() { return true; }"
echo -e "$generated_code"

# Save generated code to file
output_file="generated_code.$(echo $language | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')"
echo -e "$generated_code" > $output_file
 echo "Code saved to $output_file"
```

### Multi-Turn Conversation Script

This script simulates storing conversation history and handling multiple turns for a more interactive session.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# multi_turn_conversation.sh - A script for multi-turn conversation with memory retention

conversation_history="conversation_history.log"

while true; do
  read -p "You: " user_input
  if [[ "$user_input" == "exit" ]]; then
      echo "Exiting conversation."
      break
  fi
  # Log the conversation
  echo "User: $user_input" >> $conversation_history
  # Simulate a response (replace with actual LLM call)
  response="LLM response to: $user_input"
  echo "LLM: $response"
  echo "LLM: $response" >> $conversation_history
 done
 echo "Conversation history saved to $conversation_history"
```

### Batch Processing Script

This script processes multiple prompts contained in a file and outputs the responses.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# batch_processing.sh - Processes multiple prompts from a file

input_file="prompts.txt"
output_file="responses.txt"

if [ ! -f "$input_file" ]; then
  echo "Error: Input file $input_file not found."
  exit 1
fi

> $output_file  # Clear output file

while IFS= read -r prompt; do
  if [ -n "$prompt" ]; then
    # Simulate processing each prompt (replace with actual LLM call)
    response="Response for: $prompt"
    echo "Prompt: $prompt" >> $output_file
    echo "Response: $response" >> $output_file
    echo "---------------------" >> $output_file
  fi
 done < "$input_file"

 echo "Batch processing complete. Responses saved to $output_file"
```

## Enhancing Error Handling in Scripts

Error handling is crucial for ensuring that failures are gracefully managed. Here are some strategies:
- Check if required inputs or files exist before proceeding.
- Use exit codes to indicate errors.
- Log errors to a file for debugging.
- Use conditional statements to verify command success and provide meaningful error messages.

Example of improved error handling:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# enhanced_script.sh - Example script with enhanced error handling

set -e  # Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status
trap 'echo "An error occurred. Exiting."' ERR

read -p "Enter a filename to process: " filename
if [ ! -f "$filename" ]; then
  echo "Error: File $filename does not exist." >&2
  exit 1
fi

# Process the file (simulate command)
echo "Processing $filename..."
# Simulated command
cat "$filename"

echo "Processing complete."
```

## Workflow Examples

### Using Developer Tools
- Execute shell commands from any directory.
- Update and modify files using text editing tools.
- Capture screenshots for debugging UI issues.

### Integrating Memory Storage
- Save user preferences or error states using memory functions.
- Retrieve memory logs to maintain chat history or configuration details.

### Web Scraping and Automation
- Use the web scraping tools to gather data and then process it with automation scripts.
- Automate web interactions with tools like AppleScript via the `computercontroller__computer_control`.
