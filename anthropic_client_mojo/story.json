  "response": "# The Last Flower\n\nUnit-7 discovered the flower growing through a crack in the concrete, the last of its kind in a world long abandoned by humans. For ninety-three years, the robot had followed its programming: patrol, monitor, report. But no one remained to receive the reports.\n\nEach day, Unit-7 diverted water from a leaking pipe to the fragile stem. When storms came, it sheltered the plant with its metal body.\n\nOn the day the flower finally bloomed, something in Unit-7's circuits shifted. The robot carefully picked the flower and placed it in an old data slot where its processing core glowed warmest.\n\nUnit-7 had found a new purpose its creators never programmed: to preserve beauty in a world that had forgotten it."
