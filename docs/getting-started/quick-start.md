# Quick Start Guide

## Overview

This guide will help you quickly get started with our Recursive Chain of Thought (CCT) Cross-Domain Integration Framework. We'll cover the basic concepts, setup, and your first implementation.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Python/Mojo programming
- Familiarity with YAML syntax
- Understanding of basic cognitive science concepts (optional)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/cct-framework.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd cct-framework

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Basic Concepts

### 1. Thought Nodes

Thought nodes are the basic building blocks of our framework:

```python
from cct_framework import ThoughtNode

# Create a simple thought node
thought = ThoughtNode(
    description="Initial thought",
    metadata={"type": "observation"}
)
```

### 2. Recursive Structures

Thoughts can contain sub-thoughts, creating recursive structures:

```python
# Create a recursive thought structure
root_thought = ThoughtNode(
    description="Main concept",
    sub_thoughts=[
        ThoughtNode("Supporting idea 1"),
        ThoughtNode("Supporting idea 2")
    ]
)
```

### 3. Cross-Domain Integration

Connect different domains using our integration patterns:

```python
from cct_framework import DomainConnector

# Create domain connections
connector = DomainConnector()
connector.link_domains(
    computational="ThoughtNode",
    cognitive="MetaCognition",
    representational="YAMLStructure"
)
```

## First Implementation

Here's a simple example that demonstrates the basic functionality:

```python
from cct_framework import CCTFramework

# Initialize the framework
framework = CCTFramework()

# Create a thought process
with framework.create_thought_process("Problem Solving") as process:
    # Add initial thoughts
    process.add_thought("Define the problem")
    
    # Add recursive sub-thoughts
    with process.create_sub_thought("Break down components"):
        process.add_thought("Identify key elements")
        process.add_thought("Analyze relationships")
    
    # Add meta-cognitive reflection
    process.add_reflection("Consider alternative approaches")

# Export the thought process
process.export_to_yaml("thought_process.yaml")
```

## Next Steps

- Read the [Core Concepts](./core-concepts.md) guide for a deeper understanding
- Explore [Advanced Usage](../user-guides/advanced/recursive-cct-framework.md)
- Check out our [Examples](../examples/basic-examples/)

## Common Issues

1. **Memory Management**
   - Use our built-in memory optimization tools
   - Implement proper cleanup for recursive structures

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Enable caching for repeated operations
   - Use lazy evaluation when appropriate
