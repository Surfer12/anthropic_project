Let me explain how to use the o1-kob.py file in the anthropic_client package:

## Understanding o1-kob.py

The o1-kob.py file is a JSON formatted file containing a conversation with Anthropic's o3-mini-2025-01-31 model. It includes:

1. The model identifier ("o3-mini-2025-01-31")
2. 7 conversation interactions in a structured format
3. Developer prompts and user inputs
4. Model outputs (React components)

The file contains a complete conversation that can be used as:
- A reference example
- A template for similar conversations
- Input data for testing or extending your client

## Using o1-kob.py in your project

Here are the main ways to use this file:

### 1. As a reference model conversation

```python
import json

def load_example_conversation():
    with open('anthropic_client/o1-kob.py') as f:
        data = json.load(f)
    return data

# Access model type
model_info = load_example_conversation()
print(f"Using model: {model_info['model']}")

# Access the prompts or responses
for interaction in model_info['input']:
    if interaction['role'] == 'developer':
        print("Developer prompt:", interaction['content'][0]['text'][:100], "...")
```

### 2. With the AnthropicClient class

The client.py module provides an AnthropicClient class for making API calls. You can use o1-kob.py as a template for creating similar prompts:

```python
from anthropic_client import AnthropicClient

# Extract a prompt structure from the example
def get_example_prompt():
    import json
    with open('anthropic_client/o1-kob.py') as f:
        data = json.load(f)
    return data['input'][0]['content'][0]['text']

# Use as a starting point for a new prompt
client = AnthropicClient()
example = get_example_prompt()
custom_prompt = example.replace("recursive model", "my custom model")
response = client.get_response(custom_prompt)
```

### 3. From the command line

You can reference patterns from o1-kob.py in CLI commands:

```bash
# Extract a portion of the prompt to use
python3 -c "import json; f=open('anthropic_client/o1-kob.py'); data=json.load(f); print(data['input'][0]['content'][0]['text'][:200])" > prompt_template.txt

# Edit the template and use with the CLI
python -m anthropic_client.cli --model claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219 --format text < prompt_template.txt
```

### 4. Incorporating into your workflow

To make this file part of your development workflow:

1. Study the conversation structure to understand effective prompting patterns
2. Extract templates for recurring tasks
3. Use as test data for client development
4. Reference when building similar features

## Setup requirements

To work with this file, make sure you have:

1. The anthropic Python package installed (`pip install anthropic`)
2. An Anthropic API key set in your environment (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)
3. Python's json module (standard library)

The anthropic_client package helps simplify interactions with Anthropic's models, and the o1-kob.py file provides valuable examples of how to structure effective prompts and handle responses.
