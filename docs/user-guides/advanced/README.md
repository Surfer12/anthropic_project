   - Shared visualization and monitoring techniques

2. **Meta-Learning ↔ Cross-Domain Integration**
   - Meta-learning strategies adapt to different domains
   - Cross-domain integration enables knowledge transfer
   - Common optimization approaches

3. **Cross-Domain Integration ↔ Pattern Recognition**
   - Pattern recognition across domains
   - Integration patterns and recognition patterns
   - Shared transformation techniques
