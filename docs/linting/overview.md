# Linting Architecture Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the linting infrastructure implemented across our multi-language codebase.

## Core Principles

1. **Cross-Language Consistency**: Maintain consistent code style across different programming languages while respecting language-specific idioms.
2. **Automated Enforcement**: Leverage automated tools to enforce style guidelines and catch potential issues early.
3. **Developer Experience**: Provide clear documentation and tooling support for a smooth developer experience.
4. **Maintainability**: Ensure code remains readable and maintainable through consistent formatting and style.

## Unified Rule System

Our linting infrastructure is built around a unified rule system defined in `.linting/rules.yaml`. This central configuration ensures consistency across different language-specific linting tools.

### Key Features

- Centralized rule definitions
- Cross-language consistency checks
- Automated rule generation for language-specific tools
- Continuous integration enforcement

## Supported Languages

### Python
- Black for code formatting
- Flake8 for style checking
- mypy for type checking
- isort for import sorting

### Java
- Checkstyle for style enforcement
- PMD for code analysis
- SpotBugs for bug detection
- JaCoCo for code coverage

### Mojo
- Mojo formatter for code style
- Custom linting rules
- Type system enforcement

### C++
- clang-format for code formatting
- clang-tidy for static analysis
- Custom style enforcement

### Markdown
- markdownlint for consistent documentation
- Custom rules for project-specific needs

## Tool Integration

### Pre-commit Hooks
Pre-commit hooks automatically check and format code before commits:
```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Run hooks manually
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### CI/CD Integration
Linting checks are integrated into our CI/CD pipeline:
- Pull request validation
- Automated formatting checks
- Style consistency verification
- Type system validation

## Rule Customization

### Adding New Rules
1. Update `.linting/rules.yaml` with the new rule definition
2. Run rule standardization tool to propagate changes
3. Update documentation to reflect new requirements
4. Update CI/CD configuration if necessary

### Exemption Process
1. Document the reason for exemption
2. Get team approval
3. Add exemption to appropriate configuration
4. Document the exemption in code

## Tooling

### Rule Standardizer
The `rule_standardizer.py` tool manages rule consistency:
```bash
# Verify rule consistency
python scripts/rule_standardizer.py --verify

# Generate language-specific configs
python scripts/rule_standardizer.py --generate

# Fix inconsistencies automatically
python scripts/rule_standardizer.py --fix
```

### Type System Refiner
The `type_system_refiner.py` tool helps maintain type system consistency:
```bash
# Analyze type ignore directives
python scripts/type_system_refiner.py --analyze-only

# Fix type system issues
python scripts/type_system_refiner.py --fix
```

### Technical Debt Tracker
The `tech_debt_tracker.py` tool manages technical debt:
```bash
# Generate debt report
python scripts/tech_debt_tracker.py

# Export to JSON
python scripts/tech_debt_tracker.py --export json

# Export to CSV
python scripts/tech_debt_tracker.py --export csv
```

## Best Practices

### Code Organization
- Group imports by standard library, third-party, and local
- Maintain consistent file structure
- Use meaningful names following conventions
- Keep functions and methods focused and concise

### Documentation
- Document public APIs
- Include examples in docstrings
- Keep documentation up to date
- Use consistent documentation style

### Error Handling
- Use appropriate exception types
- Include context in error messages
- Log errors appropriately
- Clean up resources properly

### Performance
- Consider performance implications of style choices
- Use appropriate data structures
- Optimize critical paths
- Profile code when necessary

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Line Length Exceptions
When dealing with long lines:
1. Consider breaking into multiple lines
2. Use appropriate line continuation
3. Restructure code if necessary
4. Document reasons for exceptions

### Naming Conventions
When dealing with naming conflicts:
1. Follow language-specific conventions
2. Use clear and descriptive names
3. Document abbreviations
4. Maintain consistency within modules

### Import Organization
When organizing imports:
1. Group by source (stdlib, third-party, local)
2. Sort alphabetically within groups
3. Remove unused imports
4. Use appropriate import style

### Type System
When working with types:
1. Use appropriate type annotations
2. Handle forward references properly
3. Create stub files when needed
4. Document complex type relationships

## Maintenance and Updates

### Regular Reviews
- Conduct periodic rule reviews
- Update tooling as needed
- Incorporate team feedback
- Keep documentation current

### Version Control
- Track rule changes in version control
- Document significant changes
- Maintain changelog
- Plan migration paths

### Team Communication
- Discuss proposed changes
- Share best practices
- Provide training resources
- Address common issues

## Future Improvements

### Planned Enhancements
1. Enhanced IDE integration
2. Expanded rule coverage
3. Improved performance
4. Better error reporting

### Contributing
1. Review existing rules
2. Propose improvements
3. Submit pull requests
4. Update documentation
