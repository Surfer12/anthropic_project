## Action Items

1. Audit for Outdated or Missing Content

   - Note any missing content that should be present based on current system architecture.

   - Propose a unified structure to improve document discoverability.

3. Visual Assets Update
   - Evaluate current diagrams, SVGs, and images across the docs.
   - Update visual assets to accurately reflect the current system architecture.

4. Issue & Task Generation
   - For each identified documentation gap, generate issues/tasks in our project management system.
   - Include details and references to the specific areas needing updates.

5. Schedule Regular Reviews
   - Set up periodic reviews to ensure continuous improvement and consistency of documentation.

## Next Steps
