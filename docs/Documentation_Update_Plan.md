# Documentation Update Plan

## Objective

Address and update all documentation across the codebase, ensuring consistency, accuracy, and clarity in our guides, API docs, examples, and development references.

## Current Documentation Scope

- **docs/user-guide**: Contains user guides in INI and Markdown formats.
- **docs/guides**: Additional guides on usage and best practices.
- **docs/api**: API documentation outlining endpoints and protocols.
- **docs/examples**: Sample implementations and code examples.
- **docs/development**: Developer focused documentation regarding environment setup and internal processes.
- **docs/api-reference**: Detailed API reference for developers.
- **docs/css**: Styles and formatting for documentation pages.

## Proposed Updates

1. **Content Audit & Review**
   - Review each existing document for outdated information, broken references, or obsolete instructions.
   - Compare documentation against the current state of the codebase and recent architectural changes.

2. **Consolidation & Organization**
   - Identify overlapping content and merge where appropriate.
   - Introduce a unified structure and navigation to aid discoverability.

3. **Style & Consistency**
   - Develop and enforce a standardized style guide for documentation (formatting, tone, terminology).
   - Update diagrams and visual assets (e.g., SVGs) to reflect the current architecture.

4. **Integration with Codebase**
   - Align inline code comments and living documentation to ensure consistency.
   - Set up processes for documentation versioning and changelogs.

5. **Team Collaboration & Continuous Improvement**
   - Create issues and task assignments for specific documentation updates.
   - Schedule periodic reviews and updates as part of our development cycle.

## Implementation Steps

1. Perform a comprehensive audit of all documentation files in the codebase.
2. Identify and document areas requiring updates or reorganization.
3. Create individual issues or tasks for the identified updates.
4. Implement updates incrementally, with team reviews and testing where applicable.
5. Finalize changes and integrate them into the next release cycle.

## Next Steps

- Share this plan with the team for feedback.
- Prioritize documentation updates based on impact and alignment with current project needs.
- Begin working on high-priority documentation issues immediately.

## Documentation Action Items

1. Audit each documentation directory (docs/user-guide, docs/guides, docs/api, docs/examples, docs/development, docs/api-reference, docs/css) for outdated or missing content.
2. Consolidate overlapping and redundant documents into a unified structure.
3. Update visual assets (diagrams, SVGs) to reflect our current system architecture.
4. Generate specific issues/tasks in our project management system for each identified documentation gap.
5. Schedule periodic reviews to ensure continuous improvement and consistency across all documentation.
